  <p>Born and raised in the island of Oahu, Hawaii. I have seen much of the island and what it has to offer.
    While the island life was great, life had other plans for <em>me</em>. </p>
  <p>In my pursuit for a mechanical
    engineering degree, it landed my in Moscow, Idaho. You might be asking, why <strong>IDAHO</strong>!?
    Well, they had a great engineering school, and I also met some great people while I was there. I don't
    have any regrets and would do it <em>again</em> in a heartbeat. </p>
  <p>Once I finished college, finding a job in the mainland did not pan out. I ended up flying back home
    to Hawaii, where I work as a <strong><em>project manager</em></strong>. I work in the construction industry which can be
    very demanding, but the award is amazing.</p>
  <p>I'm now entering the world of web development. Which is a bit far off my current career path, but
    I wanted to pick up a new hobby. I dabbled with creating my first personal blog on Wordpress and found
    the process to be quite enjoyable (creating the site not writing the blog post). I'm dedicated to learn how
    to produce a website from scratch as I learn about HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
